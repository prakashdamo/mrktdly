## Pattern Analysis

### The Wednesday Effect
- Wednesday consistently shows the strongest performance
- 62.8% win rate across all tickers
- +0.78% average return (highest)
- Holds true for both indexes (SPY, QQQ) and individual stocks

### The Thursday Weakness
- Thursday is the only day with negative average return (-0.49%)
- 50% win rate (worst or second-worst for most tickers)
- Tesla particularly weak on Thursday (-1.44%, 29.5% win rate)

### The Monday-Wednesday Pattern
- Buying Monday and selling Wednesday captured significant gains
- SPY: +16.7%, QQQ: +21.7%, PLTR: +86.0%
- Suggests mid-week strength is real and tradeable

### The Friday-Wednesday Pattern
- Buying Friday (after Thursday weakness) and selling Wednesday (at peak) was optimal
- SPY: +30.9%, QQQ: +40.9%
- Captures the Thursday dip and Wednesday rally

## Statistical Significance

**Sample Size:**
- 264-288 observations per day across all tickers
- 44-48 observations per day per ticker
- Sufficient for meaningful patterns

**Consistency:**
- Wednesday was best or second-best for 5 out of 6 tickers
- Thursday was worst or second-worst for 5 out of 6 tickers
- Pattern holds across different market caps and sectors

## Possible Explanations (Speculation)

**Why Wednesday might be strong:**
- Mid-week momentum
- Economic data often released Wednesday morning
- Options expiry patterns (monthly)
- Institutional rebalancing

**Why Thursday might be weak:**
- Profit-taking before weekend
- Positioning ahead of Friday employment data
- Historical pattern (documented in academic literature)

**Important:** These are speculative. The data shows the pattern exists, not why.

## Practical Implications

### For Day Traders:
- Consider avoiding Thursday entries
- Wednesday shows strongest momentum
- Friday-Wednesday cycle worth monitoring

### For Swing Traders:
- Buy Thursday weakness, sell Wednesday strength
- Monday-Wednesday pattern captured 16-86% gains
- Works better on volatile stocks (PLTR) than indexes

### For Long-Term Investors:
- Pattern exists but requires 83-91 trades per year
- Transaction costs would erode gains
- Tax implications (all short-term gains)
- Not practical for most investors

## Limitations

1. **One Year of Data:** 2025 only. Pattern may not persist.
2. **Survivorship Bias:** Tested stocks that performed well in 2025.
3. **Transaction Costs:** Not included. Would reduce returns significantly.
4. **Slippage:** Real execution differs from close prices.
5. **Taxes:** Short-term gains taxed at income rate (up to 37%).
6. **Market Regime:** 2025 was mostly bullish. Bear markets may differ.
7. **Overfitting:** Optimal combinations found on same data tested.
8. **Future Performance:** Past patterns don't guarantee future results.

## Academic Context

Day-of-week effects have been studied extensively:

- **"Monday Effect"** - Historically negative Monday returns (not seen in 2025 data)
- **"Friday Effect"** - Historically positive Friday returns (mixed in 2025)
- **"Weekend Effect"** - Monday reflects weekend news (not tested here)

Our 2025 data shows different patterns than historical academic findings. This could mean:
1. Market structure has changed
2. 2025 was anomalous
3. Sample size too small
4. Different tickers than academic studies

## Recommendations

### For Blog Post:
1. Lead with the surprising finding (PLTR Thursday→Wednesday: 180%)
2. Show the aggregate data (Wednesday best, Thursday worst)
3. Present individual ticker breakdowns
4. Explain the trading strategies tested
5. Be honest about limitations
6. Don't promise future performance

### Key Message:
"In 2025, Wednesday was the strongest day and Thursday was the weakest. A strategy of buying Thursday and selling Wednesday outperformed buy & hold on PLTR by 56%. But this is one year of data with significant limitations. Interesting pattern, not investment advice."
