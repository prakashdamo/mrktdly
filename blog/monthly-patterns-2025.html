        <h1>I Looked at Every Month in 2025. Here's What I Found.</h1>
        <div class="meta">December 2, 2025 · 10 min read</div>

        <p>I pulled monthly returns for 10 tickers across 2025. I wanted to see which months were strong, which were weak, and whether any patterns emerged.</p>

        <p>Some things surprised me. May was the best month (+15% average), not the worst. September was strong, not weak. Traditional seasonal patterns didn't hold.</p>

        <p>This is one year of data. Patterns might not repeat. But here's what happened in 2025.</p>

        <h2>The Data</h2>

        <p>I analyzed 10 tickers: SPY, QQQ, PLTR, GOOGL, TSLA, NVDA, HIMS, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN.</p>

        <p>For each month from January to November, I calculated returns from the monthly open to close. Then I looked for patterns.</p>

        <h2>Monthly Performance</h2>

        <h2>What Stood Out</h2>

        <h3>May Was the Best Month</h3>

        <p>May averaged +15.1% across all tickers. Nine out of ten were positive. HIMS exploded +67.7%. TSLA gained +23.7%. NVDA added +19.5%.</p>

        <p>This contradicts the old saying "sell in May and go away." In 2025, May was the month to be invested.</p>

        <p>Will this repeat? I don't know. But in 2025, selling in May would have been a mistake.</p>

        <h3>March Was Brutal</h3>

        <p>March averaged -11.4%. All ten tickers were negative. Even the "winner" (PLTR) was down -4.7%. HIMS crashed -34.3%.</p>

        <p>This was a market-wide correction. Diversification didn't help. Everything fell.</p>

        <h3>September Was Strong</h3>

        <p>September averaged +14.4%, the second-best month. All ten tickers were positive. HIMS gained +37.2%. TSLA added +35.5%.</p>

        <p>September is traditionally a weak month. Not in 2025. It was one of the strongest.</p>

        <h3>November Pulled Back</h3>

        <p>November averaged -5.4%. Seven out of ten tickers were negative. PLTR dropped -17.8%. NVDA fell -14.9%.</p>

        <p>Profit-taking before year-end? Maybe. Or just normal volatility. Hard to say.</p>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>HIMS led five months. But it was also the worst performer four months. Extreme volatility. Big gains, big losses.</p>

        <p>GOOGL led three consecutive months (Aug-Nov). More consistent. Less dramatic.</p>

        <p>PLTR had a strong April (+41.2%) but crashed in November (-17.8%).</p>

        <h2>Consistency Matters</h2>

        <p>Leading a month is nice. But consistency matters more for most investors.</p>

        <p>PLTR and GOOGL were positive 9 out of 11 months. That's 81.8% consistency. And both delivered strong returns (+124% and +65.6%).</p>

        <p>HIMS was only positive 6 out of 11 months (54.5%). But it still returned +47.5% through extreme swings.</p>

        <p>Different approaches. PLTR/GOOGL: steady gains. HIMS: volatile but profitable.</p>

        <p>Q2 and Q3 were nearly identical in strength (+25% each). Q1 ended weak. Q4 started strong but November reversed gains.</p>

        <h2>Individual Ticker Notes</h2>

        <h3>PLTR (Palantir)</h3>
        <p>Best overall performer. +124% YTD. Positive 9/11 months. April explosion (+41.2%). November crash (-17.8%). High consistency, high returns.</p>

        <h3>GOOGL (Google)</h3>
        <p>Second-best consistency. +65.6% YTD. Positive 9/11 months. Led three consecutive months (Aug-Nov). Strong second half.</p>

        <h3>HIMS (Hims & Hers)</h3>
        <p>Most volatile. Led 5 months but crashed 4 months. May: +67.7%. August: -34.4%. September: +37.2%. October: -18.7%. Wild ride.</p>

        <h3>NVDA (Nvidia)</h3>
        <p>Solid performer. +33.4% YTD. Positive 8/11 months. May surge (+19.5%). November pullback (-14.9%). AI hype helped.</p>

        <h3>TSLA (Tesla)</h3>
        <p>Volatile but mediocre. +10% YTD. February crash (-24.2%). September surge (+35.5%). Big swings, small net gain.</p>

        <h3>SPY & QQQ (Indexes)</h3>
        <p>Most consistent. 72.7% win rate. Steady gains. SPY +15.6%, QQQ +20.9%. Boring but reliable.</p>

        <h3>AMZN (Amazon)</h3>
        <p>Worst performer. Only +5.6% YTD. Positive just 6/11 months. Disappointing year for a mega-cap.</p>

        <h2>What This Might Mean</h2>

        <p>I'm hesitant to draw strong conclusions from one year of data. But here are some observations:</p>

        <p><strong>Traditional seasonal patterns didn't hold.</strong> "Sell in May" was wrong. September weakness didn't happen. The market doesn't follow old rules.</p>

        <p><strong>Q2 and Q3 were the sweet spot.</strong> April through September averaged +50% combined. That's where the gains were.</p>

        <p><strong>March corrections happen.</strong> -11.4% average. All tickers down. No place to hide.</p>

        <p><strong>Volatility can pay.</strong> HIMS had the lowest consistency (54.5%) but still returned +47.5%. If you can stomach the swings.</p>

        <p><strong>Consistency + returns is rare.</strong> PLTR and GOOGL managed both. 81.8% win rate with strong gains. That's the ideal.</p>

        <h2>The Limitations</h2>

        <p>This is one year. 2025. That's it.</p>

        <p>Patterns might not repeat. May might be weak in 2026. September might crash. March might rally.</p>

        <p>I'm not predicting the future. I'm describing what happened in 2025.</p>

        <p>Also:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sample size is small (11 months, 10 tickers)</li>
            <li>Survivorship bias (didn't include stocks that crashed completely)</li>
            <li>Market regime matters (2025 was mostly bullish)</li>
            <li>Past performance doesn't guarantee future results</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I'm Taking Away</h2>

        <p>After looking at every month in 2025, here's what I learned:</p>

        <p><strong>1. Traditional patterns don't always hold.</strong> May was strong, not weak. September was strong, not weak. Don't blindly follow old rules.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Corrections happen fast.</strong> March dropped -11.4% in one month. All tickers fell. Diversification didn't help.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Recovery can be strong.</strong> April-May gained +21.6% combined. The bounce was powerful.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Consistency matters more than I thought.</strong> PLTR and GOOGL's 81.8% win rate is impressive. Steady gains compound.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Volatility is a choice.</strong> HIMS delivered +47.5% but with brutal swings. SPY delivered +15.6% smoothly. Pick your poison.</p>

        <p><strong>6. One year isn't enough.</strong> I need more data before drawing strong conclusions. This is interesting, not actionable.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>In 2025, May was the best month (+15.1%). March was the worst (-11.4%). HIMS led 5 months but crashed 4 times. PLTR and GOOGL were positive 9/11 months with strong returns.</p>

        <p>Traditional seasonal patterns didn't hold. "Sell in May" was wrong. September was strong, not weak.</p>

        <p>This is one year of data. Patterns might not repeat. I'm not making predictions. Just sharing what happened.</p>

        <div class="insight-box">
            <p><strong>Final Thought:</strong> I went into this expecting to find clear seasonal patterns. Instead, I found that 2025 didn't follow the traditional rules. May was strong. September was strong. March crashed.</p>
            
            <p>Maybe the market has changed. Maybe 2025 was unique. Maybe I need more data.</p>
            
            <p>What I do know: consistency matters. PLTR and GOOGL were positive 9/11 months. That's more valuable than leading one month and crashing the next.</p>
            
            <p>One year of data. Interesting patterns. No strong conclusions.</p>
